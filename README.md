## Description
>GoChariot (GC) is a web application, accessible via a web browser, that is used to track and interact with UNCG's Spartan Chariots.
>GC is designed to reimplement UNCG's Chariot tracking system and expand upon it by adding features that are useful for the UNCG community as a whole.
>The motivation behind GC is due to the fact that UNCG's current Spartan Chariot tracking is clunky and lacks any meaningful features.
>The goal of GC is to create a web app that is useful, easy to use, and increases safety for both students and drivers.
>This goal will be accomplished by numerous features for students and drivers. Students will be able to request rides, view/add driver reviews, and view bus routes. Drivers will be able to send out safety alerts, view planned routes, view their reviews, and view ride requests.
